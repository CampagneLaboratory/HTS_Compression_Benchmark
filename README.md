This repository contains the benchmark scripts for the high-throughput sequencing data compression benchmark described in (Campagne et al 2013 PLOS One)[http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0079871].
Data necessary for the benchmark are distributed at http://data.campagnelab.org/home/compression-of-structured-high-throughput-sequencing-data.

# Requirements
In order to run this benchmark, you need access to a cluster with Sun Grid Engine installed and a number of programs already installed. Key requirements are Java, Groovy and samtools. The benchmark was developed in 2012 and is mostly maintained so that it keeps running.
